    "Hello! I'm Eleazar - though most people know me as Zar. With a\
    background in mechanical engineering, I discovered my love for\
    programming during my studies at BCIT and while working in the field.\
    From automating mechanical systems to creating simulations in Maple\
    15, Visual Basic, MATLAB, LabVIEW and C, I was always drawn to\
    problem-solving through code. My passion for web development was\
    sparked when friends in software development introduced me to the\
    world of building interactive and dynamic applications - turning\
    simple lines of code into something impactful felt like magic.",

    "My goal is to become a full-stack software developer and explore the\
    endless possibilities the world of software development has to offer.\
    I'm excited to continue learning and pushing my skills further.",

    "When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors through\
    hiking, weightlifting at the gym, hitting the slopes snowboarding, or\
    playing sports like basketball, volleyball and badminton. I'm also a\
    fan of video games and can often be caught belting out karaoke tunes\
    at Filipino parties or soundproof karaoke rooms."
